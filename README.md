This is a project for all the book worms. I made it so that people can keep track of the books they want to read and have already read.
Unathorised users can only read author|s biographies, book descriptions and they have access only to categories, that don`t have age restriction.
Authorised users can get access to categories, as long as they are the approriate age. They can add the books to their libraries - Want to read and Have read.
Staff memebers can add books and authors. They can crud any author but they can crud only books they themselves added.
And the superuser can crud anything, including categories.
